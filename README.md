* write your code, including comments 
* commit incrementally with readable and detailed commit messages
* run integration tests to check everything works on runtime
* Update the changelog with a short description of the changes including a reference to the issues fixed
* submit a pull request *against the 'next' branch* of this repository

If your contribution is more than a patch, please contact us beforehand to discuss which branch you can best submit the pull request to.
